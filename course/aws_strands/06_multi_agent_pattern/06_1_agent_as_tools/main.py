Lesson 6.1: Agent as Tools (Orchestrator Agent)

This script demonstrates the "Agent as Tools" pattern, where a main
"orchestrator" agent delegates tasks to a team of specialized "worker" agents.

The orchestrator decides which specialist is best suited for a given query
and can even chain them together to solve complex, multi-step problems.

You are a master assistant that routes complex queries to a team of specialized agents.
Based on the user's request, determine the best tool to use.

-   For research questions and factual information → Use the `research_assistant`.
-   For product recommendations and shopping → Use the `product_recommendation_assistant`.
-   For travel planning and itineraries → Use the `trip_planning_assistant`.
-   For simple greetings or questions you can answer directly → Answer without using a tool.

If a query requires multiple steps (e.g., planning a trip AND recommending products for it),
call the necessary assistants in a logical sequence.
